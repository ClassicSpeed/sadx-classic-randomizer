# Sonic Adventure DX - classic randomizer

Sonic Adventure DX Randomizer, compatible with archipelago

## Instructions

Follow
the [Archipelago guide](https://github.com/ClassicSpeed/Archipelago/blob/sadx_initial_version/worlds/sadx/docs/setup_en.md)

## Known Issues (Probably won't fix)

- Tails' Rhythm badge is not a check (it's in the past).
- Knuckles can freely enter Red Mountain, there is no monkey to destroy.

## Things that won't be added:

- Configuration for messages besides the archipelago ones.
- Auto update for the mod. It adds manual extra manual work for the release, and it could break your current randomizer.
