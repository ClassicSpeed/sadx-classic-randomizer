  # Determines the goal of the seed
  # Emblems (0): You have to collect a certain number of emblems to unlock the Perfect Chaos Fight.
  # Chaos Emerald Hunt (1): You have to collect all 7 Chaos Emeralds to unlock the Perfect Chaos Fight.
  #   There won't be any emblems in the item pool, only filler items and traps depending on your options.
  # Emblems and Chaos Emerald Hunt (2): You have to collect both emblems and the emeralds to fight Perfect Chaos.

  #  Hard Logic (2): The most unforgiving logic, some checks require to do precise jumps or glitches.
